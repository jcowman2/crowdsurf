## Introduction

__Crowdsurf is a game about improvisation.__

You play a band's lead singer, who has forgotten the lyrics to his songs during a concert.
It's your job to come up with new lyrics that match the original themes of your songs.

The game consists of 3 songs. At the start of each song, you'll be given a short list of keywords.
You're scored based on how well your lyrics relate to these keywords. You can also earn points for having clever rhymes.

For example, if the keywords are "glass," "orange," and "game," you could write the following line:

> Pour me a glass of that juice

The word *glass* is a direct match to one of your keywords, but the word *juice* is related to *glass* and *orange*. Therefore, this line would earn you three matches!

## Controls

While a song is playing, you sing just by typing the text and pressing enter.

You can also do any of these actions during a song by typing an asterisk (*) before the command.
* key   - View the song's keywords.
* stop  - End the song early.
* ???   - What could this secret command be?
