## Introduction

__Crowdsurf is a game about improvisation.__

You play a band's lead singer, who has forgotten the lyrics to his songs during a concert.
It's your job to come up with new lyrics that match the original themes of your songs.

The game consists of 3 songs. At the start of each song, you'll be given a short list of keywords.
You're scored based on how well your lyrics relate to these keywords. You can also earn points for having clever rhymes.

## Controls

While a song is playing, you sing just by typing the text and pressing enter.
You can also do any of these actions during a song by typing an asterisk (*) before the command.
* key   - View the song's keywords.
* stop  - End the song early.
* ???   - What could this secret command be?
